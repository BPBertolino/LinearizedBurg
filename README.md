# LinearizedBurg
Algorithm for linearization and computation of error prediction vectors via the Burg algorithm for well logs in the context of geosciences.

The code here was created as a proof of concept for performing data treatment of well logs,
in order to put in evidence certain properties which may facilitate their interpretation by geologists.
Modified versions of it are meant to be implemented as plugins to the Petrel software.
